Hi there, I'm <a href="https://www.prince.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Prince</a> üëã
</h3>
<h2 align="center">
I'm a Back-end Developer.
</h2> 
I started my journey as a backend developer using Java, which quickly became my favorite programming language. As I gained more experience, I discovered the Spring framework, which made developing complex applications much easier. I started using Spring for dependency injection, AOP, and building REST APIs.

As I became more proficient with Spring, I discovered Spring Boot, which allowed me to quickly create production-ready applications with minimal configuration. With Spring Boot, I could easily create standalone Spring applications that could be deployed to production without requiring any additional setup.

Along with Spring and Spring Boot, I also gained experience using MySQL as my primary database. I learned how to design and build relational databases, write efficient SQL queries, and use Hibernate to interact with the database from my Spring applications.

Throughout my journey as a backend developer, I have gained experience building scalable and maintainable web applications using Java, Spring, Spring Boot, and MySQL. I have worked on a variety of projects, ranging from small-scale REST APIs to large-scale enterprise applications.

I am passionate about software development and am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.
